"The Coder's Quest"

In silent glow of screens so bright,
A coder toils through day and night.
With keys that click and lines that grow,
They weave the spells that machines know.

A bug appears—oh, cruel fate!
A loop that runs, but won’t terminate.
They trace the logs with weary eyes,
Debugging truths in cold disguise.

Yet joy arrives—a match is found!
A function works, its logic sound.
The terminal sings, the tests all pass,
A fleeting win—but not their last.

For code is art, both wild and wise,
A dance of thought in zeros and ones.
And though the errors never cease,
The coder fights… and finds their peace.
